# Omni Cach Sidecar

Sidecar for your caching needs along CI workloads.

Note: project is very WIP but it extracts logic from caching used in [Cirrus Runners](https://cirrus-runners.app/) and [Cirrus CI](https://cirrus-ci.org/) which handle millions of caches monthly. Subscribe to releases and wait for version 1.0.0.
